  2. [Analysis](nb/A2_analyze_nitrate.ipynb)
2. Compilation of nitrate fluxes
  1. [Compiling nitrate fluxes](nb/B1_compile_fluxes.ipynb)
  2. [Analyzing that compilation](nb/B2_analyze_fluxes.ipynb)
3. [Comparison of nitrate stocks and fluxes with primary production](nb/C_primary_production.ipynb)
