  abstract =      {AbstractEvery summer, intense sea ice melt around the
                   margins of the Arctic pack ice leads to a stratified
                   surface layer, potentially without a traditional
                   surface mixed layer. The associated strengthening of
                   near-surface stratification has important
                   consequences for the redistribution of near-inertial
                   energy, ice{\^a}ocean heat fluxes, and vertical
                   replenishment of nutrients required for biological
                   growth. The authors describe the vertical structure
                   of meltwater layers and quantify their seasonal
                   evolution and their effect on turbulent mixing in the
                   oceanic boundary layer by analyzing more than 450
                   vertical profiles of velocity microstructure in the
                   seasonal ice zone north of Svalbard. The vertical
                   structure of the density profiles can be summarized
                   by an equivalent mixed layer depth hBD, which scales
                   with the depth of the seasonal stratification. As the
                   season progresses and melt rates increase, hBD shoals
                   following a robust pattern, implying stronger
                   vertical stratification, weaker vertical eddy
                   diffusivity, and reduced vertical extent of the
                   mixing layer, which is bounded by hBD. Through most
                   of the seasonal pycnocline, the vertical eddy
                   diffusivity scales inversely with buoyancy frequency
                   (K{\"I} {\^a} N{\^a}1). The presence of
                   mobile sea ice alters the magnitude and vertical
                   structure of turbulent mixing primarily through
                   stronger and shallower stratification, and thus
                   vertical eddy diffusivity is greatly reduced under
                   sea ice. This study uses these results to develop a
                   quantitative model of surface layer turbulent mixing
                   during Arctic summer and discuss the impacts of a
                   changing sea ice cover.},

                   have implied positive impacts of eddies on
                   phytoplankton biomass. However, direct observations
                   for estimating vertical nutrient fluxes in various
                   parts of eddies are still lacking; these could
                   explain the mechanism of high phytoplankton biomass
                   associated with eddies compared to their
                   surroundings. Here, we conducted
                   conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) surveys with
                   water sampling to examine the characteristics of a
                   cyclonic warm-core eddy found over the Chukchi shelf
                   slope in late summer 2015. Furthermore, we measured
                   ocean microstructures to estimate vertical nutrient
                   fluxes and their contributions to nutrient uptake by
                   phytoplankton. The results imply that nutrients were
                   supplied to the euphotic zone from a lower layer
                   through vertical shear mixing near the center of the

  abstract =      {This review paper integrates the current knowledge,
                   based on available literature, on the physical and
                   biological conditions of the Amerasian and Eurasian
                   basins (AB, EB) of the deep Arctic Ocean (AO) in a
                   comparative fashion. The present day (Holocene) AO is
                   a mediterranean sea that is roughly half continental
                   shelf and half basin and ridge complex. Even more
                   recently it is roughly two thirds seasonally and one
                   third perennially ice-covered, thus now exposing a
                   portion of basin waters to sunlight and wind. Basin
                   boundaries and submarine ridges steer circulation
                   pathways in overlying waters and limit free exchange
                   in deeper waters. The AO is made integral to the
                   global ocean by the Northern Hemisphere Thermohaline
                   Circulation (NHTC) which drives Pacific-origin water
                   (PW) through Bering Strait into the Canada Basin, and
                   counter-flowing Atlantic-origin water (AW) through
                   Fram Strait and across the Barents Sea into the
                   Nansen Basin. As a framework for biogeography within
                   the AO, four basic, large-scale circulation systems
                   (with L{$>$}1000km) are noted; these are: (1) the
                   large scale wind-driven circulation which forces the
                   cyclonic Trans-Polar Drift from Siberia to the Fram
                   Strait and the anticyclonic Beaufort Gyre in the
                   southern Canada Basin; (2) the circulation of waters
                   that comprise the halocline complex, composed largely
                   of waters of Pacific and Atlantic origin that are
                   modified during passage over the Bering/Chukchi and
                   Barents/Siberian shelves, respectively; (3) the
                   topographically-trapped Arctic Circumpolar Boundary
                   Current (ACBC) which carries AW cyclonically around
                   the boundaries of the entire suite of basins, and (4)
                   the very slow exchange of Arctic Ocean Deep Waters.
                   Within the basin domain two basic water mass
                   assemblies are observed, the difference between them
                   being the absence or presence of PW sandwiched
                   between Arctic Surface Waters (ASW) above and the AW
                   complex below; the boundary between these domains is
                   the Atlantic/Pacific halocline front. Both domains
                   have vertical stratification that constrains the
                   transfer of nutrients to the surface layer (euphotic
                   zone), thus leading to their oligotrophic state,
                   particularly in the more strongly stratified Pacific
                   Arctic where, despite high nutrient values in the
                   inflow, convective reset of surface layer nutrients
                   by haline convection in winter is virtually absent.
                   First and multi-year sea ice drastically alters
                   albedo and insulates the underlying water column from
                   extreme winter heat loss while its mechanical
                   properties (thickness, concentration, roughness,
                   etc.) greatly affect the efficiency of momentum
                   transfer from the wind to the underlying water.
                   Biologically, sea ice algal growth in the basins is
                   proportionally almost equal to or exceeding
                   phytoplankton production, and is a habitat and
                   transport platform for sympagic (ice-associated)
                   fauna. Owing to nutrient limitation due to strong
                   stratification and light limitation due to snow and
                   ice cover and extreme sun angle, primary production
                   in the two basin domains is very low compared to the
                   adjacent shelves. Severe nutrient limitation and
                   complete euphotic zone drawdown in the AB favors
                   small phytoplankton, a ubiquitous deep chlorophyll
                   maximum layer, a low f-ratio of new to recycled
                   carbon fixation, and a low energy food web. In
                   contrast, nutrients persist \textendash{}albeit in
                   low levels\textendash{} in the western EB, even in
                   summer, suggesting light limitation, heavy grazing or
                   both. The higher stocks of nutrients in the EB are
                   more conducive to marginal ice blooms than in the AB.
                   The large-scale ocean currents (NHTC and ACBC) import
                   substantial expatriate, not locally reproducing
                   zooplankton biomass especially from the adjoining
                   subarctic Atlantic (primarily Calanus finmarchicus),
                   but also from the Pacific (e.g., Pseudocalanus spp.,
                   Neocalanus spp. and Metridia pacifica). These
                   advective inputs serve both as source of food to
                   resident pelagic and benthic biota within the basins,
                   and as potential grazers exerting top down control on
                   limited phytoplankton resources. Benthic organisms
                   within the AO basin show previously unappreciated
                   biodiversity and surprising dispersion of species
                   given the isolation of individual basins and low
                   vertical carbon flux and resulting biomass. Larval
                   dispersion is aided by the large-scale flows and
                   perhaps, we hypothesize in the deep benthos by
                   convective updrafts driven by geothermal heating.
                   Zooplankton diversity, in contrast, is low, but again
                   faunal assemblages are equally distributed between
                   the EB and AB. Species pools of both pelagic and
                   benthic communities change more with water depth
                   rather than laterally, with the exception of
                   expatriates and rare species, with close ties to
                   today's North Atlantic biogeographic region. Climate
                   related change in the AO is thus manifest at
                   significantly differing time scales. Throughout
                   {$\sim$}90\% of the Pleistocene the AO has existed in
                   glacial mode, with narrow continental shelves,
                   greatly restricted river inflow, thicker and perhaps
                   immobile sea ice, and total blockage of exchange with
                   the Pacific Ocean. During the Holocene, on shorter
                   time scales of 1000\textendash{}100years, significant
                   changes in high latitude climate are tied to changes
                   in temperature and perhaps moisture delivery
                   patterns. The Arctic also experiences significant
                   multi-decadal variability; however, the pace of
                   change over the past three decades has been without
                   precedent. Within the basin interior the ice is now
                   thinner and less compact, and thus more responsive to
                   wind stress (forcing and mixing). Concurrent with sea
                   ice melt and increased river flow, the accumulation
                   of fresh water and the stratification have increased,
                   thus constraining vertical nutrient flux affecting
                   phytoplankton size distributions, limiting primary
                   production in parts of the basins now and likely in
                   the future, and increasing vulnerability to
                   acidification. In addition, sea ice is now retreating
                   on an annual basis past the shelf break, exposing
                   basin waters directly to sunlight and wind forcing.
                   Thus, upwelling favorable winds (generally from east
                   to west) can now directly and efficiently drive
                   shelf-break upwelling, and draw nutrients from
                   subsurface basin waters onto the shelf; at the same
                   time upwelling favorable winds will also create
                   onshore pressure gradients over the slope and basin
                   which will act to slow or block the flow of waters in
                   the ACBC, and thus alter advective pathways of both
                   abiotic and biotic materials. Given the opening of a
                   new ocean to multiple user groups, we expect that the
                   central AO will play an increasing larger role both
                   in the research and political arenas in the future,
                   and we encourage pan-Arctic international
                   collaboration over focus on territorial boundaries.},

  abstract =      {Detailed predictions of the downward particulate
                   organic carbon (POC) flux in a future Arctic are
                   challenging due to the poor understanding of
                   potential drivers. Short-term sediment traps, partly
                   modified with gel-containing jars, were deployed in
                   the Barents Sea (BS) and in Adventfjorden, Svalbard,
                   to determine the downward POC flux and the particle
                   flux ({$\geq$} 0.05 mm equivalent spherical diameter
                   ESDimage) in a parallel manner. In this way, the
                   quality of the sinking material could be linked to
                   the downward POC flux and this link gave new insights
                   into potential drivers of the carbon flux. In the
                   Barents Sea, the highest downward POC flux (260-670
                   mg POC m\^-2 d\^-1) occurred in ice-free, deeply
                   mixed waters. Sinking particles were {$<$} 1.00 mm
                   ESDimage and had a high POC: volume ratio. Pulsed
                   nitrate injections from deeper layers most likely
                   stimulated new production, and the downward flux was
                   enhanced by vertical mixing and ``biomass
                   repackaging'' into fast-sinking pellets by
                   zooplankton. In Adventfjorden, the highest POC flux
                   (770-1530 mg POC m\^-2 d\^-1) occurred during autumn,
                   coinciding with glacial run-off. Large, fast-sinking
                   particles (0.05-3.62 mm ESDimage) apparently enhanced
                   the downward POC, despite their low POC: volume
                   ratio. In addition, entrained terrestrial POC
                   enhanced the downward POC flux. Ballasting effects by
                   entrained lithogenic material, flocculation and
                   aggregate formation by pteropods are likely, but need
                   further investigation. The present study illustrates
                   that a high downward POC flux in Arctic marine
                   ecosystems may occur during the phytoplankton bloom,
                   but the highest POC downward fluxes found in the BS
                   and Adventfjorden were found in deep-mixed waters
                   during a post bloom situation or during an autumn
                   situation influenced by glacial run-off,
                   respectively. It is also shown, that a high POC
                   downward flux may not only be caused by large
                   particles, but also by small particles with a high
                   POC: volume ratio.},

                   biological production in the Arctic Ocean. While
                   dissolved inorganic N (DIN) is well studied, the
                   substantial pool of N bound in organic matter (OM)
                   and its bioavailability in the system is rarely
                   considered. Covering a full annual cycle, we here
                   follow N and carbon (C) content in particulate (P)
                   and dissolved (D) OM within the Atlantic water inflow
                   to the Arctic Ocean. While POC, PON, and DOC
                   accumulated in the surface waters from January to
                   May, the DON-pool decreased substantially ({$\Delta$}
                   - 50 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}g N L-1). The DON reduction was
                   greater than the simultaneous reduction in DIN
                   ({$\Delta$} - 30 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}g N L-1),
                   demonstrating that DON is a valuable N-source
                   supporting the growing biomass. While the
                   accumulating POM had a C/N ratio close to Redfield,
                   the asynchronous accumulation of C and N in the
                   dissolved pool resulted in a drastic increase in the
                   C/N ratio of DOM during the spring bloom. This is
                   likely due to a combination of the reduction in DON,
                   and a high release of carbon-rich sugars from
                   phytoplankton, as 32\% of the spring primary
                   production was dissolved. Our findings thus caution
                   calculations of particulate primary production from
                   DIN drawdown. During post-bloom the DON pool
                   increased 3-fold due to an enhanced microbial
                   processing of organic matter and reduced
                   phytoplankton production. The light absorption
                   spectra of DOM revealed high absorption within the UV
                   range during spring bloom indicating DOM with low
                   molecular weight in this period. The `spring CDOM
                   signal' was not present in August and absorption in
                   the winter months was low. Our results demonstrate
                   that the change in ecosystem function (i.e.
                   phytoplankton species and activity, bacterial
                   activity and grazing) in different seasons is
                   associated with strong changes in the C/N ratios and
                   optical character of DOM and underpin the essential
                   role of DON for the production cycle in the Arctic.},

                   within a Lagrangian time-series study using the
                   tracer sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Four ARGOS buoys
                   initially released at the patch centre remained
                   closely associated with the SF6 patch over a 10-day
                   period, with the near-circular eddy streamlines
                   contributing to the stability and coherence of the
                   patch. Progressive deepening of the surface mixed
                   layer was temporarily interrupted by a storm, which
                   increased mixed-layer nitrate and accelerated the
                   transfer of SF6 to the atmosphere. Diapycnal exchange
                   of SF6 was relatively rapid due to the shallow
                   pycnocline gradient, and a vertical eddy diffusivity
                   (Kz) of 1.95cm2s-1 at the base of the mixed layer was
                   estimated from vertical SF6 profiles at the patch
                   centre. Application of Kz to the nutrient gradients
                   inferred vertical nitrate and phosphate fluxes of 1.8
                   and 1.25mmolm-2d-1, respectively, for the pre-storm
                   period, which accounted for 33\% and 20\% of the
                   reported in vivo uptake rates. Integration of the
                   vertical nitrate flux and decline in surface layer
                   nitrate suggest a total loss of 0.54mmolNm-3d-1
                   during the 5-day pre-storm period, of which in vivo
                   nitrate consumption only accounted for 49\%. Vertical
                   transport of ammonium regenerated in the pycnocline
                   accounted for up to 25\% of in vivo phytoplankton
                   uptake. The results suggest that the contribution of
                   vertical turbulence to the mixed-layer nutrient pool
                   was less important than that recorded in other
                   regions of the open ocean, inferring that advective
                   processes are more significant in an eddy. This study
                   also emphasises the potential of SF6 for oceanic
                   Lagrangian time series studies, particularly in
                   dynamic regions, and in constraining estimates of new
                   production.},

                   eddy in the northeast Atlantic in June 1996. The

                   balance calculation was possible for these three
                   nutrients. Over a 5-day period, there was a combined
                   decline in nitrate and ammonium concentrations of

                   nitrate fluxes with frontal-zone primary production
                   demands. In the mixed area during weak winds, the
                   dissipation rate varies strongly over the semidiurnal
                   tidal period in close relation to the tidal current
                   strength, varies with the monthly/fortnightly tidal
                   modulation, and generally increases with distance
                   below the sea surface. Collectively, these features
                   provide strong support for the elevated vertical
                   mixing rates on Georges Bank being primarily due to
                   the tides, although wind forcing also contributes
                   significantly. In the frontal zone on northern
                   Georges Bank, the upper-ocean dissipation rates are
                   about an order of magnitude weaker than in the mixed
                   area, have a more complex temporal variation during
                   the tidal period, and also vary with the
                   monthly/fortnightly tidal modulation. The vertical
                   eddy flux of nitrate into the frontal euphotic zone
                   varies over the tidal period and with the tidal
                   modulation. Averaged over the tidal period, the
                   estimated fluxes are about one-third of the nitrogen
                   demand estimated from concurrent primary production
                   measurements, supportive of an important contribution
                   from turbulent mixing to new production in the
                   frontal zone, but also pointing to additional
                   processes and/ or inadequate data coverage of this
                   complex zone. The measured dissipation rates at both
                   the mixed and frontal sites are in approximate

                   flux were simultaneously determined on the
                   continental shelf of the East China Sea (ECS).
                   Further, the archaeal amoA gene was quantified to
                   examine the potential distribution of nitrification
                   activity. Nitrate assimilation rates and distribution
                   of the archaeal amoA gene were also investigated in
                   the Philippine Sea and in the Kuroshio Current. At
                   all the stations, while the surface nitrate was
                   depleted ({$<$}0.1 ?M), active nitrate assimilation
                   was observed with mean rates of 1400, 270, and 96
                   ?molN m?2 d?1 in the ECS, the Philippine Sea, and the
                   Kuroshio Current, respectively. Archaeal amoA was
                   observed at shallower light depths, namely at or
                   above 10\% light depth, in the ECS than in other
                   regions, suggesting that nitrification occurred
                   within the euphotic zone in the ECS, especially on
                   the shelf. Moreover, a station on the continental
                   shelf of the ECS exhibited a considerable discrepancy
                   between the nitrate assimilation rate (1500 ?molN m?2
                   d?1) and vertical nitrate flux (98 ?molN m?2 d?1).
                   Here, 6.7 {$\pm$} 3.1 ? 103 and 2.5 {$\pm$} 0.7 ? 105
                   copies mL?1 of archaeal amoA were detected at 10\%
                   and 1\% light depths relative to the surface,
                   respectively. Thus nitrification within the euphotic
                   zone would be attributed at least in part to the
                   observed discrepancy between nitrate assimilation and
                   vertical flux. These observations imply that the
                   assumption of a direct relationship between new
                   production, export production, and measured nitrate
                   assimilation is misplaced, particularly regarding the
                   continental shelf of the ECS.},

  abstract =      {Microbial activity is a fundamental component of
                   oceanic nutrient cycles. Photosynthetic microbes,
                   collectively termed phytoplankton, are responsible
                   for the vast majority of primary production in marine
                   waters. The availability of nutrients in the upper
                   ocean frequently limits the activity and abundance of
                   these organisms. Experimental data have revealed two
                   broad regimes of phytoplankton nutrient limitation in
                   the modern upper ocean. Nitrogen availability tends
                   to limit productivity throughout much of the surface
                   low-latitude ocean, where the supply of nutrients
                   from the subsurface is relatively slow. In contrast,
                   iron often limits productivity where subsurface
                   nutrient supply is enhanced, including within the
                   main oceanic upwelling regions of the Southern Ocean
                   and the eastern equatorial Pacific. Phosphorus,
                   vitamins and micronutrients other than iron may also
                   (co-)limit marine phytoplankton. The spatial patterns
                   and importance of co-limitation, however, remain
                   unclear. Variability in the stoichiometries of
                   nutrient supply and biological demand are key
                   determinants of oceanic nutrient limitation.
                   Deciphering the mechanisms that underpin this
                   variability, and the consequences for marine
                   microbes, will be a challenge. But such knowledge
                   will be crucial for accurately predicting the
                   consequences of ongoing anthropogenic perturbations
                   to oceanic nutrient biogeochemistry.},

                   the far side of the North Pole from the Atlantic, but
                   it is becoming more like its larger neighbor as the

                   sea-ice loss is a leading indicator of climate change
                   and can be attributed, in large part, to atmospheric
                   forcing. Here, we show that recent ice reductions,
                   weakening of the halocline, and shoaling of the
                   intermediate-depth Atlantic Water layer in the
                   eastern Eurasian Basin have increased winter
                   ventilation in the ocean interior, making this region
                   structurally similar to that of the western Eurasian
                   Basin. The associated enhanced release of oceanic
                   heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate
                   now comparable to losses from atmospheric
                   thermodynamic forcing, thus explaining the recent
                   reduction in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian
                   Basin. This encroaching ``atlantification'' of the
                   Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a
                   new Arctic climate state, with a substantially
                   greater role for Atlantic inflows.},

                   of Svalbard is dominated by the advection of warm,
                   salty and nutrient-rich Atlantic Water (AW). This
                   oceanic heat contributes to keeping the area
                   relatively free of ice. The last years have seen a
                   dramatic decrease in regional sea ice extent, which
                   is expected to drive large increases in pelagic
                   primary production and thereby changes in marine
                   ecology and nutrient cycling. In a concerted effort,
                   we conducted five cruises to the area in winter,
                   spring, summer and fall of 2014, in order to
                   understand the physical and biogeochemical controls
                   of carbon cycling, for the first time from a
                   year-round point of view. We document (1) the
                   offshore location of the wintertime front between
                   salty AW and fresher Surface Water in the ocean

                   over the shelf slope, likely enhancing vertical

  abstract =      {The Arctic Ocean is currently on a fast track toward
                   seasonally ice-free conditions. Although most
                   attention has been on the accelerating summer sea ice
                   decline, large changes are also occurring in winter.
                   This study assesses past, present, and possible
                   future change in regional Northern Hemisphere sea ice
                   extent throughout the year by examining sea ice
                   concentration based on observations back to 1950,
                   including the satellite record since 1979. At
                   present, summer sea ice variability and change
                   dominate in the perennial ice-covered Beaufort,
                   Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, and Kara Seas, with
                   the East Siberian Sea explaining the largest fraction
                   of September ice loss (22\%). Winter variability and
                   change occur in the seasonally ice-covered seas
                   farther south: the Barents Sea, Sea of Okhotsk,
                   Greenland Sea, and Baffin Bay, with the Barents Sea
                   carrying the largest fraction of loss in March
                   (27\%). The distinct regions of summer and winter sea
                   ice variability and loss have generally been
                   consistent since 1950, but appear at present to be in
                   transformation as a result of the rapid ice loss in
                   all seasons. As regions become seasonally ice free,
                   future ice loss will be dominated by winter. The Kara
                   Sea appears as the first currently perennial
                   ice-covered sea to become ice free in September.
                   Remaining on currently observed trends, the Arctic
                   shelf seas are estimated to become seasonally ice
                   free in the 2020s, and the seasonally ice-covered
                   seas farther south to become ice free year-round from

                   its patchy, episodic nature and a scarcity of direct
                   measurements, especially in the Arctic Ocean. In this
                   study, we exploit a historical record of nearly 3,000
                   conductivity-temperature-depth profiles collected in
                   the shelf and shelf-slope waters of the Canadian
                   Arctic Ocean from 2002 to 2016 to characterize the
                   variability of 28,872 internal wave-driven turbulent
                   dissipation and mixing rate estimates from a
                   finescale parameterization. We find that these
                   estimates of wave-driven dissipation rates and
                   associated diapycnal diffusivities are generally low,
                   but exhibit wide variability, each spanning several
                   orders of magnitude. We further find that
                   stratification plays a significant role in modulating
                   the mixing rate both vertically and regionally within
                   the study domain. Dissipation rate and diffusivity
                   estimates display a weak seasonal cycle, but no
                   evidence of statistically significant interannual
                   trends over this period. Exceptionally large
                   localized temporal variability appears to dominate
                   other potential underlying patterns. The presence of
                   strong upper ocean stratification combined with
                   predominately weak dissipation rate estimates implies
                   that many regions in the Canadian Arctic Ocean are
                   likely in a molecular or buoyancy-controlled mixing
                   regime. Even when the concept of a turbulent-enhanced
                   diffusivity is potentially relevant, most turbulent
                   heat flux estimates out of the Atlantic Water
                   thermocline are smaller than the average value
                   required to close the standardly assumed Arctic Ocean
                   heat budget. In contrast, we find evidence for
                   isolated occurrences of anomalously large heat
                   fluxes, which may disproportionately contribute to
                   the liberation of Atlantic Water heat toward the
                   surface sea ice pack.},

                   the ice into the ocean. New model simulations
                   comprising variable sea ice drag coefficients for

                   trends of ocean surface stress during the last
                   decades. Simulations with constant sea ice drag
                   coefficients as used in most climate models show an
                   increase in annual mean ocean surface stress (0.003
                   N/m2 per decade, 4.6\%) due to the reduction of ice
                   thickness leading to a weakening of the ice and
                   accelerated ice drift. In contrast, with variable
                   drag coefficients our simulations show annual mean

                   1980\textendash{}2013 because of a significant
                   reduction in surface roughness associated with an
                   increasingly thinner and younger sea ice cover. The
                   effectiveness of sea ice in transferring momentum
                   does not only depend on its resistive strength
                   against the wind forcing but is also set by its top
                   and bottom surface roughness varying with ice types
                   and ice conditions. This reveals the need to account
                   for sea ice surface roughness variations in climate
                   simulations in order to correctly represent the
                   implications of sea ice loss under global warming.},

                   diffusion of nitrate ({$<$} 10-3 mmol m-2 d-1). An
                   estimate was made of the two-dimensional advective
                   balance of nitrate between upwelling and the

                   variation in the uptake rate of nitrate and ammonium
                   in the Central Atlantic was studied. The calculated
                   diffusive nitrate flux showed a sharp latitudinal
                   gradient, with the lowest nitrate supply (0.00037

                   rate of nitrate was inhibited at high irradiance at

                   respectively) at the southern end of the transect and

                   being much greater for ammonium than for nitrate
                   uptake. The f-ratio was highest ({$\approx$}0.4) just

                   measurements, in surface waters (4.72 {$\pm$} 1.54)
                   was somewhat lower, but not significantly so, than
                   the expected C/N ratio of 6.6. The average uptake
                   rate of nitrate did not differ significantly from the
                   average estimated diffusive supply of nitrate to the
                   biogenic layer over the Central Atlantic. However,
                   the nitrate uptake rate increased as the
                   {$\textfrac{1}{3}$} power of the diffusive nitrate
                   flux to the biogenic layer. As a result, nitrate
                   uptake far exceeded (by up to 100-fold) the nitrate
                   flux to the biogenic layer in the stations where the
                   supply of nitrate was lowest. The excess nitrate
                   uptake averaged 0.65 {$\pm$} 0.24 mmol NO3 m-2 d-1
                   (range, 0.05\textendash{}1.9 mmol NO3 m-2 d-1), which
                   must be supplied through atmospheric deposition and
                   other perturbation events. This excess nitrate uptake
                   is relatively large compared to the diffusive supply
                   in the most unproductive areas, where external
                   nitrate inputs fuel the new production. In contrast,
                   these sources of nitrate are far less significant
                   where high diffusive fluxes suffice to maintain high
                   nitrate uptake rates.},

  volume =        {52},
  year =          {2007},
  abstract =      {Measurements of the intra-tidal and spring-neap
                   variation in the vertical flux of nitrate into the
                   base of the sub-surface chlorophyll maximum (SCM)
                   were made at the shelf edge of the Celtic Sea, a
                   region with strong internal mixing driven by an
                   internal tide. The neap tide daily mean nitrate flux
                   was 1.3 (0.9-1.8, 95\% confidence interval) mmol m-2
                   d-1. The spring tide flux was initially estimated as
                   3.5 (2.3-5.2, 95\% confidence interval) mmol m-2 d-1.
                   The higher spring tide nitrate flux was the result of
                   turbulent dissipation occurring within the base of
                   the SCM as compared to deeper dissipation during neap
                   tides and was dominated by short events associated
                   with the passage of internal solitons. Taking into
                   account the likely under-sampling of these short
                   mixing events raised the spring tide nitrate flux
                   estimate to about 9 mmol m-2 d-1. The neap tide
                   nitrate flux was sufficient to support substantial
                   new production and a considerable fraction of the
                   observed rates of carbon fixation. Spring tide fluxes
                   were potentially in excess of the capacity of the
                   phytoplankton community to uptake nitrate. This
                   potential excess nitrate flux during spring tides may
                   be utilized to support new production during the
                   lower mixing associated with the transition toward
                   neap tide. The shelf edge is shown to be a region
                   with a significantly different phytoplankton
                   community as compared to the adjacent Celtic Sea and
                   northeast Atlantic Ocean, highlighting the role of
                   gradients in physical processes leading to gradients
                   in ecosystem structure.},

                   seasonally stratified western Irish Sea using the
                   dissipation method. By comparing the divergence of
                   the reported benthic and diapcynal nitrate fluxes, we
                   are able to explain much of the observed annual
                   summer decline in deep-water nitrate at this
                   location. We then show that the new production,
                   fuelled by the diapcynal nitrate flux, is of a
                   similar magnitude to that associated with the spring
                   bloom. This suggests that the physical processes
                   responsible for the diapcynal nitrate flux will set
                   the limit on new production at this location.
                   High-resolution mid-water column ADCP measurements
                   show an average thermocline gradient Richardson
                   number of 1, thus suggesting episodes of enhanced
                   shear could result in shear instability, and
                   therefore mixing within the thermocline. Bulk shear
                   measurements reveal episodes of enhanced shear in the
                   form of spikes, during which time the bulk shear
                   vector takes the form of a clockwise rotating vector
                   which has a period close to the local inertial
                   period. The episodes of shear spikes are correlated
                   to the wind and are consistent with observations made
                   elsewhere. Estimates of profiles of the rate of
                   dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy, based on
                   microstructure velocity measurements, show that
                   during a shear spike the dissipation rate within the
                   thermocline, and therefore the buoyancy (and nitrate)
                   flux, is enhanced by a factor of 4 when compared to
                   periods with no shear spikes. Intermittent shear
                   spikes are, therefore, an important mechanism for
                   enhancing mixing across the shelf sea seasonal
                   thermocline, and therefore delivery of nitrate to the
                   euphotic zone, at this location.},

                   organic carbon (POC) exported from the surface waters
                   of the world ocean and remineralized at depth is
                   critical to constraining models of the global carbon
                   cycle, yet remains controversial. The use of upper
                   ocean sediment traps is still one of the primary
                   tools for determining this export flux, although trap
                   fluxes have been shown to vary significantly because
                   of hydrodynamic and sample collection biases. Over
                   the past decade, 234Th increasingly has been used as
                   a tracer to estimate POC export from the euphotic
                   zone by multiplying the depth-integrated 234Th flux
                   by the POC/234Th ratio of sinking particles. The
                   accuracy of this technique is highly dependent on the
                   natural variability in the POC/234Th ratio and 234Th
                   flux, yet the significance of this variability to
                   estimates of POC export remains uncertain. Based on
                   an analysis of new 234Th and POC data from the
                   Labrador Sea and a review of 25 previous independent
                   field studies, we report that POC export fluxes can
                   vary 2\textendash{}10 times or more solely because of
                   variability in the POC/234Th ratio and procedures
                   used to estimate the 234Th flux. Recommended
                   improvements include studies of the biological,
                   chemical, and physical mechanisms controlling
                   234Th-organic matter interactions in seawater;

                   source of surface nutrients within an anticyclonic
                   eddy in the NE Atlantic, we investigate vertical
                   transport processes that may produce such a
                   phenomenon. For the eddy investigated, the dominant
                   mechanism is found to be ageostrophic circulation
                   resulting from a perturbation of the circular flow of
                   the eddy. This can produce upwelling velocities of
                   order 10md-1. Ekman pumping due to wind stress on the
                   eddy also produces upwelling within, but on a smaller
                   scale of {$\sim$}0.5md-1. There is no evidence that
                   self-propagation of the eddy leads to an enhanced
                   nutrient flux by displacement upwards of
                   nutrient-laden deeper isopycnals over the core of the
                   eddy. Deeper winter mixing within the eddy relative
                   to the surroundings, however, may contribute to the
                   elevated nutrient levels.},

                   importance of terrigenous nutrients in this
                   environment is poorly understood. This study couples
                   estimates of circumpolar riverine nutrient fluxes
                   from the PARTNERS (Pan-Arctic River Transport of
                   Nutrients, Organic Matter, and Suspended Sediments)
                   Project with a regionally configured version of the
                   MIT general circulation model to develop estimates of
                   the distribution and availability of dissolved
                   riverine N in the Arctic Ocean, assess its importance
                   for primary production, and compare these estimates
                   to potential bacterial production fueled by riverine
                   C. Because riverine dissolved organic nitrogen is
                   remineralized slowly, riverine N is available for
                   uptake well into the open ocean. Despite this, we
                   estimate that even when recycling is considered,
                   riverine N may support 0.5\textendash{}1.5 Tmol C
                   year-1 of primary production, a small proportion of
                   total Arctic Ocean photosynthesis. Rapid uptake of

                   high rates of dissolved organic nitrogen regeneration
                   in N-limited nearshore regions, however, leads to
                   potential localized rates of riverine-supported
                   photosynthesis that represent a substantial
