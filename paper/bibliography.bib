  abstract =      {AbstractEvery summer, intense sea ice melt around the
                   margins of the Arctic pack ice leads to a stratified
                   surface layer, potentially without a traditional
                   surface mixed layer. The associated strengthening of
                   near-surface stratification has important
                   consequences for the redistribution of near-inertial
                   energy, ice{\^a}ocean heat fluxes, and vertical
                   replenishment of nutrients required for biological
                   growth. The authors describe the vertical structure
                   of meltwater layers and quantify their seasonal
                   evolution and their effect on turbulent mixing in the
                   oceanic boundary layer by analyzing more than 450
                   vertical profiles of velocity microstructure in the
                   seasonal ice zone north of Svalbard. The vertical
                   structure of the density profiles can be summarized
                   by an equivalent mixed layer depth hBD, which scales
                   with the depth of the seasonal stratification. As the
                   season progresses and melt rates increase, hBD shoals
                   following a robust pattern, implying stronger
                   vertical stratification, weaker vertical eddy
                   diffusivity, and reduced vertical extent of the
                   mixing layer, which is bounded by hBD. Through most
                   of the seasonal pycnocline, the vertical eddy
                   diffusivity scales inversely with buoyancy frequency
                   (K{\"I} {\^a} N{\^a}1). The presence of
                   mobile sea ice alters the magnitude and vertical
                   structure of turbulent mixing primarily through
                   stronger and shallower stratification, and thus
                   vertical eddy diffusivity is greatly reduced under
                   sea ice. This study uses these results to develop a
                   quantitative model of surface layer turbulent mixing
                   during Arctic summer and discuss the impacts of a
                   changing sea ice cover.},

                   forcing, hastening the ongoing transition towards a
                   seasonally open Arctic Ocean. This reflects several
                   mutually supporting processes. Because of the
                   extensive open water in recent Septembers, ice cover
                   in the following spring is increasingly dominated by
                   thin, first-year ice (ice formed during the previous
                   autumn and winter) that is vulnerable to melting out
                   in summer. Thinner ice in spring in turn fosters a
                   stronger summer ice-albedo feedback through earlier
                   formation of open water areas. A thin ice cover is
                   also more vulnerable to strong summer retreat under
                   anomalous atmospheric forcing. Finally, general
                   warming of the Arctic has reduced the likelihood of
                   cold years that could bring about temporary recovery
                   of the ice cover. Events leading to the September ice
                   extent minima of recent years exemplify these
                   processes.},

                   counter-flowing Atlantic-origin water (AW) through
                   Fram Strait and across the Barents Sea into the
                   Nansen Basin. As a framework for biogeography within
                   the AO, four basic, large-scale circulation systems
                   (with L{$>$}1000km) are noted; these are: (1) the
                   large scale wind-driven circulation which forces the
                   cyclonic Trans-Polar Drift from Siberia to the Fram
                   Strait and the anticyclonic Beaufort Gyre in the
                   southern Canada Basin; (2) the circulation of waters
                   that comprise the halocline complex, composed largely
                   of waters of Pacific and Atlantic origin that are
                   modified during passage over the Bering/Chukchi and
                   Barents/Siberian shelves, respectively; (3) the
                   topographically-trapped Arctic Circumpolar Boundary
                   Current (ACBC) which carries AW cyclonically around
                   the boundaries of the entire suite of basins, and (4)
                   the very slow exchange of Arctic Ocean Deep Waters.
                   Within the basin domain two basic water mass
                   assemblies are observed, the difference between them
                   being the absence or presence of PW sandwiched
                   between Arctic Surface Waters (ASW) above and the AW
                   complex below; the boundary between these domains is
                   the Atlantic/Pacific halocline front. Both domains
                   have vertical stratification that constrains the
                   transfer of nutrients to the surface layer (euphotic
                   zone), thus leading to their oligotrophic state,
                   particularly in the more strongly stratified Pacific
                   Arctic where, despite high nutrient values in the
                   inflow, convective reset of surface layer nutrients
                   by haline convection in winter is virtually absent.
                   First and multi-year sea ice drastically alters
                   albedo and insulates the underlying water column from
                   extreme winter heat loss while its mechanical
                   properties (thickness, concentration, roughness,
                   etc.) greatly affect the efficiency of momentum
                   transfer from the wind to the underlying water.
                   Biologically, sea ice algal growth in the basins is
                   proportionally almost equal to or exceeding
                   phytoplankton production, and is a habitat and
                   transport platform for sympagic (ice-associated)
                   fauna. Owing to nutrient limitation due to strong
                   stratification and light limitation due to snow and
                   ice cover and extreme sun angle, primary production
                   in the two basin domains is very low compared to the
                   adjacent shelves. Severe nutrient limitation and
                   complete euphotic zone drawdown in the AB favors
                   small phytoplankton, a ubiquitous deep chlorophyll
                   maximum layer, a low f-ratio of new to recycled
                   carbon fixation, and a low energy food web. In
                   contrast, nutrients persist \textendash{}albeit in
                   low levels\textendash{} in the western EB, even in
                   summer, suggesting light limitation, heavy grazing or
                   both. The higher stocks of nutrients in the EB are
                   more conducive to marginal ice blooms than in the AB.
                   The large-scale ocean currents (NHTC and ACBC) import
                   substantial expatriate, not locally reproducing
                   zooplankton biomass especially from the adjoining
                   subarctic Atlantic (primarily Calanus finmarchicus),
                   but also from the Pacific (e.g., Pseudocalanus spp.,
                   Neocalanus spp. and Metridia pacifica). These
                   advective inputs serve both as source of food to
                   resident pelagic and benthic biota within the basins,
                   and as potential grazers exerting top down control on
                   limited phytoplankton resources. Benthic organisms
                   within the AO basin show previously unappreciated
                   biodiversity and surprising dispersion of species
                   given the isolation of individual basins and low
                   vertical carbon flux and resulting biomass. Larval
                   dispersion is aided by the large-scale flows and
                   perhaps, we hypothesize in the deep benthos by
                   convective updrafts driven by geothermal heating.
                   Zooplankton diversity, in contrast, is low, but again
                   faunal assemblages are equally distributed between
                   the EB and AB. Species pools of both pelagic and
                   benthic communities change more with water depth
                   rather than laterally, with the exception of
                   expatriates and rare species, with close ties to
                   today's North Atlantic biogeographic region. Climate
                   related change in the AO is thus manifest at
                   significantly differing time scales. Throughout
                   {$\sim$}90\% of the Pleistocene the AO has existed in
                   glacial mode, with narrow continental shelves,
                   greatly restricted river inflow, thicker and perhaps
                   immobile sea ice, and total blockage of exchange with
                   the Pacific Ocean. During the Holocene, on shorter
                   time scales of 1000\textendash{}100years, significant
                   changes in high latitude climate are tied to changes
                   in temperature and perhaps moisture delivery
                   patterns. The Arctic also experiences significant
                   multi-decadal variability; however, the pace of
                   change over the past three decades has been without
                   precedent. Within the basin interior the ice is now
                   thinner and less compact, and thus more responsive to
                   wind stress (forcing and mixing). Concurrent with sea
                   ice melt and increased river flow, the accumulation
                   of fresh water and the stratification have increased,
                   thus constraining vertical nutrient flux affecting
                   phytoplankton size distributions, limiting primary
                   production in parts of the basins now and likely in
                   the future, and increasing vulnerability to
                   acidification. In addition, sea ice is now retreating
                   on an annual basis past the shelf break, exposing
                   basin waters directly to sunlight and wind forcing.
                   Thus, upwelling favorable winds (generally from east
                   to west) can now directly and efficiently drive
                   shelf-break upwelling, and draw nutrients from
                   subsurface basin waters onto the shelf; at the same
                   time upwelling favorable winds will also create
                   onshore pressure gradients over the slope and basin
                   which will act to slow or block the flow of waters in
                   the ACBC, and thus alter advective pathways of both
                   abiotic and biotic materials. Given the opening of a
                   new ocean to multiple user groups, we expect that the
                   central AO will play an increasing larger role both
                   in the research and political arenas in the future,
                   and we encourage pan-Arctic international
                   collaboration over focus on territorial boundaries.},

  abstract =      {The main environmental factors driving spatial
                   patterns, variability and change in primary
                   production (PP) in the Arctic Ocean are reviewed.
                   While instantaneous PP rates are predominantly
                   influenced by the local factors affecting light
                   penetration through clouds, sea ice and water, net PP
                   (NPP) at the annual scale is conditioned by a
                   hierarchy of remote and local processes that affect
                   nutrient supply and light availability in general.
                   Nutrient supply sets spatial differences in realized
                   or potential trophic status (i.e. oligotrophic or
                   eutrophic), whereas light availability modulates PP
                   within each regime. Horizontal nutrient supply
                   through Atlantic and Pacific ocean gateways differ
                   markedly, which is explained by their position at
                   opposite ends of the global meridional overturning
                   circulation and imbalanced nitrogen (N) cycling in
                   the Pacific sector. Nutrient supply by rivers is
                   locally important, but does not appear to sustain a
                   major portion of overall pan-Arctic NPP so far.
                   Horizontal nutrient inputs to the surface Arctic
                   Ocean are eventually transferred to the halocline
                   through winter convection and the decomposition of
                   settling organic matter. The subsequent re-injection
                   of these nutrients to the euphotic zone varies by two
                   orders of magnitude across sectors, depending on the
                   strength and persistence of the vertical
                   stratification. Such differences in nutrient delivery
                   are commensurate with those of PP and NPP rates.
                   Widespread N deficiency in surface waters fosters the
                   occurrence and seasonal persistence of subsurface
                   layers of maximum chlorophyll a (SCM) and
                   phytoplankton carbon biomass in several sectors. The
                   contribution of these layers to NPP is possibly
                   higher in the Arctic than in thermally-stratified
                   waters of the subtropical gyres due to a combination
                   of extreme acclimation to low light and a shallow
                   nitracline in the former. The overall impacts of SCM
                   layers on biogeochemical fluxes remain to be
                   quantified directly, both regionally and at the
                   pan-Arctic scale. While CO2 intake by the Arctic
                   Ocean should respond positively to reduced sea-ice
                   extent, which facilitates air-sea exchange, the
                   negative influence of rising temperatures and runoff
                   on CO2 solubility might counteract the positive
                   effect of modest PP increases in seasonally open
                   waters. Overall, this review shows that local changes
                   in light availability resulting from reduced sea-ice
                   is only one factor in the intricate web of local and
                   remote drivers of PP and CO2 drawdown in the Arctic
                   Ocean. Understanding and predicting change requires
                   an integrated biogeochemical approach that connects
                   the small Arctic Ocean to adjacent ones and
                   adequately resolves vertical nutrient supply
                   processes at regional and local scales. (C) 2015

  abstract =      {Biogeochemical-Argo is the extension of the Argo
                   array of profiling floats to include floats that are
                   equipped with biogeochemical sensors for pH, oxygen,
                   nitrate, chlorophyll, suspended particles, and
                   downwelling irradiance. Argo is a highly regarded,
                   international program that measures the changing
                   ocean temperature (heat content) and salinity with
                   profiling floats distributed throughout the ocean.
                   Newly developed sensors now allow profiling floats to
                   also observe biogeochemical properties with
                   sufficient accuracy for climate studies. This
                   extension of Argo will enable an observing system
                   that can determine the seasonal to decadal-scale
                   variability in biological productivity, the supply of
                   essential plant nutrients from deep-waters to the
                   sunlit surface layer, ocean acidification, hypoxia,
                   and ocean uptake of CO2. Biogeochemical-Argo will
                   drive a transformative shift in our ability to
                   observe and predict the effects of climate change on
                   ocean metabolism, carbon uptake, and living marine
                   resource management. Presently, vast areas of the
                   open ocean are sampled only once per decade or less,
                   with sampling occurring mainly in summer. Our ability
                   to detect changes in biogeochemical processes that
                   may occur due to the warming and acidification driven
                   by increasing atmospheric CO2, as well as by natural
                   climate variability, is greatly hindered by this
                   undersampling. In close synergy with satellite
                   systems (which are effective at detecting global
                   patterns for a few biogeochemical parameters, but
                   only very close to the sea surface and in the absence
                   of clouds), a global array of biogeochemical sensors
                   would revolutionize our understanding of ocean carbon
                   uptake, productivity, and deoxygenation. The array
                   would reveal the biological, chemical, and physical
                   events that control these processes. Such a system
                   would enable a new generation of global ocean
                   prediction systems in support of carbon cycling,
                   acidification, hypoxia and harmful algal blooms
                   studies, as well as the management of living marine
                   resources. In order to prepare for a global
                   Biogeochemical-Argo array, several prototype
                   profiling float arrays have been developed at the
                   regional scale by various countries and are now
                   operating. Examples include regional arrays in the
                   Southern Ocean (SOCCOM ), the North Atlantic
                   Sub-polar Gyre (remOcean ), the Mediterranean Sea
                   (NAOS ), the Kuroshio region of the North Pacific
                   (INBOX ), and the Indian Ocean (IOBioArgo ). For
                   example, the SOCCOM program is deploying 200
                   profiling floats with biogeochemical sensors
                   throughout the Southern Ocean, including areas
                   covered seasonally with ice. The resulting data,
                   which are publically available in real time, are
                   being linked with computer models to better
                   understand the role of the Southern Ocean in
                   influencing CO2 uptake, biological productivity, and
                   nutrient supply to distant regions of the world
                   ocean. The success of these regional projects has
                   motivated a planning meeting to discuss the
                   requirements for and applications of a global-scale
                   Biogeochemical-Argo program. The meeting was held
                   11-13 January 2016 in Villefranche-sur-Mer, France
                   with attendees from eight nations now deploying Argo
                   floats with biogeochemical sensors present to discuss
                   this topic. In preparation, computer simulations and
                   a variety of analyses were conducted to assess the
                   resources required for the transition to a
                   global-scale array. Based on these analyses and
                   simulations, it was concluded that an array of about
                   1000 biogeochemical profiling floats would provide
                   the needed resolution to greatly improve our
                   understanding of biogeochemical processes and to
                   enable significant improvement in ecosystem models.
                   With an endurance of four years for a
                   Biogeochemical-Argo float, this system would require
                   the procurement and deployment of 250 new floats per
                   year to maintain a 1000 float array. The lifetime
                   cost for a Biogeochemical-Argo float, including
                   capital expense, calibration, data management, and
                   data transmission, is about \$100,000. A global
                   Biogeochemical-Argo system would thus cost about
                   \$25,000,000 annually. In the present Argo paradigm,
                   the US provides half of the profiling floats in the
                   array, while the EU, Austral/Asia, and Canada share
                   most the remaining half. If this approach is adopted,
                   the US cost for the Biogeochemical-Argo system would
                   be \textasciitilde\$12,500,000 annually and
                   \textasciitilde\$6,250,000 each for the EU, and
                   Austral/Asia and Canada. This includes no direct
                   costs for ship time and presumes that float
                   deployments can be carried out from future research
                   cruises of opportunity, including, for example, the
                   international GO-SHIP program
                   (http://www.go-ship.org). The full-scale
                   implementation of a global Biogeochemical-Argo system
                   with 1000 floats is feasible within a decade. The
                   successful, ongoing pilot projects have provided the
                   foundation and start for such a system.},

  abstract =      {Detailed predictions of the downward particulate
                   organic carbon (POC) flux in a future Arctic are
                   challenging due to the poor understanding of
                   potential drivers. Short-term sediment traps, partly
                   modified with gel-containing jars, were deployed in
                   the Barents Sea (BS) and in Adventfjorden, Svalbard,
                   to determine the downward POC flux and the particle
                   flux ({$\geq$} 0.05 mm equivalent spherical diameter
                   ESDimage) in a parallel manner. In this way, the
                   quality of the sinking material could be linked to
                   the downward POC flux and this link gave new insights
                   into potential drivers of the carbon flux. In the
                   Barents Sea, the highest downward POC flux (260-670
                   mg POC m\^-2 d\^-1) occurred in ice-free, deeply
                   mixed waters. Sinking particles were {$<$} 1.00 mm
                   ESDimage and had a high POC: volume ratio. Pulsed
                   nitrate injections from deeper layers most likely
                   stimulated new production, and the downward flux was
                   enhanced by vertical mixing and ``biomass
                   repackaging'' into fast-sinking pellets by
                   zooplankton. In Adventfjorden, the highest POC flux
                   (770-1530 mg POC m\^-2 d\^-1) occurred during autumn,
                   coinciding with glacial run-off. Large, fast-sinking
                   particles (0.05-3.62 mm ESDimage) apparently enhanced
                   the downward POC, despite their low POC: volume
                   ratio. In addition, entrained terrestrial POC
                   enhanced the downward POC flux. Ballasting effects by
                   entrained lithogenic material, flocculation and
                   aggregate formation by pteropods are likely, but need
                   further investigation. The present study illustrates
                   that a high downward POC flux in Arctic marine
                   ecosystems may occur during the phytoplankton bloom,
                   but the highest POC downward fluxes found in the BS
                   and Adventfjorden were found in deep-mixed waters
                   during a post bloom situation or during an autumn
                   situation influenced by glacial run-off,
                   respectively. It is also shown, that a high POC
                   downward flux may not only be caused by large
                   particles, but also by small particles with a high
                   POC: volume ratio.},

                   results from inflowing Atlantic water. This inflowing
                   water is warmer than it has been in the past 2,000
                   years1,2. Yet the fate of this heat remains
                   uncertain3, partly because the water is relatively
                   saline, and thus dense: it therefore enters the
                   Arctic Ocean at intermediate depths and is separated
                   from surface waters by stratification. Vertical
                   mixing is generally weak within the Arctic Ocean
                   basins, with very modest heat fluxes
                   (0.05\textendash{}0.3 W m-2) arising largely from
                   double diffusion4,5,6,7,8. However, geographically
                   limited observations have indicated substantially
                   enhanced turbulent mixing rates over rough
                   topography9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we present
                   pan-Arctic microstructure measurements of turbulent
                   kinetic energy dissipation. Our measurements further
                   demonstrate that the enhanced continental slope
                   dissipation rate, and by implication vertical mixing,
                   varies significantly with both topographic steepness
                   and longitude. Furthermore, our observations show
                   that dissipation is insensitive to sea-ice
                   conditions. We identify tides as the main energy
                   source that supports the enhanced dissipation, which
                   generates vertical heat fluxes of more than 50 W m-2.
                   We suggest that the increased transfer of momentum
                   from the atmosphere to the ocean as Arctic sea ice
                   declines is likely to lead to an expansion of mixing

                   across the seasonal nitracline during the Arctic

                   biological production in the Arctic Ocean. While
                   dissolved inorganic N (DIN) is well studied, the
                   substantial pool of N bound in organic matter (OM)
                   and its bioavailability in the system is rarely
                   considered. Covering a full annual cycle, we here
                   follow N and carbon (C) content in particulate (P)
                   and dissolved (D) OM within the Atlantic water inflow
                   to the Arctic Ocean. While POC, PON, and DOC
                   accumulated in the surface waters from January to
                   May, the DON-pool decreased substantially ({$\Delta$}
                   - 50 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}g N L-1). The DON reduction was
                   greater than the simultaneous reduction in DIN
                   ({$\Delta$} - 30 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}g N L-1),
                   demonstrating that DON is a valuable N-source
                   supporting the growing biomass. While the
                   accumulating POM had a C/N ratio close to Redfield,
                   the asynchronous accumulation of C and N in the
                   dissolved pool resulted in a drastic increase in the
                   C/N ratio of DOM during the spring bloom. This is
                   likely due to a combination of the reduction in DON,
                   and a high release of carbon-rich sugars from
                   phytoplankton, as 32\% of the spring primary
                   production was dissolved. Our findings thus caution
                   calculations of particulate primary production from
                   DIN drawdown. During post-bloom the DON pool
                   increased 3-fold due to an enhanced microbial
                   processing of organic matter and reduced
                   phytoplankton production. The light absorption
                   spectra of DOM revealed high absorption within the UV
                   range during spring bloom indicating DOM with low
                   molecular weight in this period. The `spring CDOM
                   signal' was not present in August and absorption in
                   the winter months was low. Our results demonstrate
                   that the change in ecosystem function (i.e.
                   phytoplankton species and activity, bacterial
                   activity and grazing) in different seasons is
                   associated with strong changes in the C/N ratios and

                   Primary production on the coast and in Greenland
                   fjords sustains important local and sustenance
                   fisheries. However, unprecedented melting of the
                   Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is impacting the coastal
                   ocean, and its effects on fjord ecology remain
                   understudied. It has been suggested that as glaciers
                   retreat, primary production regimes may be altered,
                   rendering fjords less productive. Here we investigate
                   patterns of primary productivity in a northeast
                   Greenland fjord (Young Sound,
                   74\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}}\&thinsp;N), which
                   receives run-off from the GrIS via land-terminating
                   glaciers. We measured size fractioned primary
                   production during the ice- free season along a
                   spatial gradient of meltwater influence. We found
                   that, apart from a brief under-ice bloom during
                   summer, primary production remains low (between 50
                   and
  200\&thinsp;mg\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{-2}\&thinsp;d\textsuperscript{-1})
  but steady throughout the ice-free season, even into the fall. Low
  productivity is due to freshwater run-off from land-terminating glaciers
  causing low light availability and strong vertical stratification limiting
  nutrient availability. The former is caused by turbid river inputs in the
  summer restricting phytoplankton biomass to the surface and away from the
  nitracline. In the outer fjord where turbidity plays less of a role in light
  limitation, phytoplankton biomass moves higher in the water column in the
  fall due to the short day length as the sun angle decreases. Despite this,
  plankton communities in this study were shown to be well adapted to low-light
  conditions, as evidenced by the low values of saturating irradiance for
  primary production
  (5.8\textendash{}67\&thinsp;{$\mathrm{\mu}$}mol\&thinsp;photons\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{-2}\&thinsp;s\textsuperscript{-1}).
  With its low but consistent production across the growing season, Young Sound
  offers an alternative picture to other more productive fjords which have
  highly productive spring and late summer blooms and limited fall production.
  However, patterns of primary productivity observed in Young Sound are not
  only due to the influence from land-terminating glaciers but are also
  consequences of the nutrient-depleted coastal boundary currents and the
  shallow entrance sill, features which should also be considered when
  generalizing about how primary production will be affected by glacier retreat
  in the future.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

                   average depth of 100 m; the maximum depth is 360 m,
                   and a sill at a depth of 45 m is found at its
                   entrance. Sea ice covers the fjord from early October
                   to late July. The freshwater input to the fjord,
                   occurring from June to September, is 1063
                   \texttimes{} 106 m3 from the catchment area (3109
                   km2) and 440 \texttimes{} 106 m3 from melting of sea
                   ice. During the ice-free period this buoyancy input
                   and mixing by wind and tides results in an estuarine
                   circulation in which lighter low-salinity water is
                   moved seaward above denser water from the Greenland
                   Sea. The tidal amplitude is 0.8 to 1.5 m, and the
                   transport of tides from the outer parts of the fjord
                   to the inner parts is delayed less than 15 min due to
                   low friction in the fjord system. During the ice-free
                   period, a net carbon input of 15\textendash{}50 t C
                   d-1 occurs in the outer region of the fjord due to
                   transport from land and the adjacent Greenland Sea. A
                   regional atmosphere-ocean model predicts a
                   temperature increase of 6\textendash{}8\textdegree{}C
                   at the end of this century (2071\textendash{}2100)
                   that will lead to increase in freshwater runoff,
                   thinning of the sea ice, and an increase in ice-free
                   conditions from 2.5 mo to 4.7\textendash{}5.3 mo in
                   Young Sound. The increased freshwater input will
                   greatly enhance the estuarine circulation and
                   nutrient input to the fjord and is expected to
                   increase biological productivity.},

  abstract =      {The land-to-ocean flux of organic carbon is
                   increasing in glacierized regions in response to
                   increasing temperatures in the Arctic (Hood et al.,
                   2015). In order to understand the response in
                   ecosystem metabolism to the organic carbon input it
                   is essential to determine the bioavailability of the
                   different carbon sources in the system. We quantified
                   the bacterial turnover of organic carbon in a high
                   Arctic fjord system (Young Sound, NE Greenland)
                   during the ice-free period (July-October 2014) and
                   assessed the quality and quantity of the 3 major
                   organic carbon sources; 1) local phytoplankton
                   production 2) runoff from land-terminating glaciers
                   and a lowland river and 3) inflow from the ocean
                   shelf. We found that despite relatively low
                   concentrations of DOC in the rivers, the
                   bioavailability of the river\textendash{}DOC was
                   significantly higher than in the fjord, and
                   characterized by high cell-specific bacterial
                   production and low C:N ratios. In contrast, the
                   allochthonous DOC source entering via inflow of
                   coastal shelf waters had elevated DOC concentrations
                   with low bioavailability, high C:N and low specific
                   bacterial production. The phytoplankton production in
                   the fjord could not sustain the bacterial carbon
                   demand, but was still the major source of organic
                   carbon for bacterial growth. We assessed the
                   bacterial community composition and found that
                   communities were specific for the different water
                   types i.e. the bacterial community of the coastal
                   coastal inflow water could be traced mainly in the
                   subsurface water, while the glacial river community
                   strongly dominated the surface water in the fjord.},

                   mixed layer of an anticyclonic eddy at

                   within a Lagrangian time-series study using the
                   tracer sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Four ARGOS buoys
                   initially released at the patch centre remained
                   closely associated with the SF6 patch over a 10-day
                   period, with the near-circular eddy streamlines
                   contributing to the stability and coherence of the
                   patch. Progressive deepening of the surface mixed
                   layer was temporarily interrupted by a storm, which
                   increased mixed-layer nitrate and accelerated the
                   transfer of SF6 to the atmosphere. Diapycnal exchange
                   of SF6 was relatively rapid due to the shallow
                   pycnocline gradient, and a vertical eddy diffusivity
                   (Kz) of 1.95cm2s-1 at the base of the mixed layer was
                   estimated from vertical SF6 profiles at the patch
                   centre. Application of Kz to the nutrient gradients
                   inferred vertical nitrate and phosphate fluxes of 1.8
                   and 1.25mmolm-2d-1, respectively, for the pre-storm
                   period, which accounted for 33\% and 20\% of the
                   reported in vivo uptake rates. Integration of the
                   vertical nitrate flux and decline in surface layer
                   nitrate suggest a total loss of 0.54mmolNm-3d-1
                   during the 5-day pre-storm period, of which in vivo
                   nitrate consumption only accounted for 49\%. Vertical
                   transport of ammonium regenerated in the pycnocline
                   accounted for up to 25\% of in vivo phytoplankton
                   uptake. The results suggest that the contribution of
                   vertical turbulence to the mixed-layer nutrient pool
                   was less important than that recorded in other
                   regions of the open ocean, inferring that advective
                   processes are more significant in an eddy. This study
                   also emphasises the potential of SF6 for oceanic
                   Lagrangian time series studies, particularly in
                   dynamic regions, and in constraining estimates of new
                   production.},

                   eddy in the northeast Atlantic in June 1996. The
                   stability of the eddy resulted in greatly reduced
                   exchange with adjacent water masses, and hence a mass
                   balance calculation was possible for these three
                   nutrients. Over a 5-day period, there was a combined
                   decline in nitrate and ammonium concentrations of
                   2.22mmolNm-3. In vitro estimates of nitrate and
                   ammonium assimilation were estimated to be

                   the observed decrease in nitrate plus ammonium. In
                   the case of phosphate, in vitro experiments estimated
                   phosphate uptake to be 0.092mmolPm-3 over 3 days, and

                   concentration in the surface 12m over the same period

                   were 77\% of the observed changes in phosphate
                   concentration. Thus, this study provides evidence
                   that the two approaches of a mass balance calculation
                   and an in vitro determination give similar answers,
                   within a factor of 0.3, to the estimation of nutrient

                   nitrate fluxes with frontal-zone primary production
                   demands. In the mixed area during weak winds, the
                   dissipation rate varies strongly over the semidiurnal
                   tidal period in close relation to the tidal current
                   strength, varies with the monthly/fortnightly tidal
                   modulation, and generally increases with distance
                   below the sea surface. Collectively, these features
                   provide strong support for the elevated vertical
                   mixing rates on Georges Bank being primarily due to
                   the tides, although wind forcing also contributes
                   significantly. In the frontal zone on northern
                   Georges Bank, the upper-ocean dissipation rates are
                   about an order of magnitude weaker than in the mixed
                   area, have a more complex temporal variation during
                   the tidal period, and also vary with the
                   monthly/fortnightly tidal modulation. The vertical
                   eddy flux of nitrate into the frontal euphotic zone
                   varies over the tidal period and with the tidal
                   modulation. Averaged over the tidal period, the
                   estimated fluxes are about one-third of the nitrogen
                   demand estimated from concurrent primary production
                   measurements, supportive of an important contribution
                   from turbulent mixing to new production in the
                   frontal zone, but also pointing to additional
                   processes and/ or inadequate data coverage of this
                   complex zone. The measured dissipation rates at both
                   the mixed and frontal sites are in approximate
                   agreement with the turbulence levels in two 3-D
                   numerical models for summertime tidal and mean
                   circulation on the Bank, one with and eddy-viscosity
                   and the other an advanced turbulence closure. The
                   latter model has more realistic vertical turbulence
                   distributions and indicates strong sensitivity of the
                   turbulence levels to horizontal position in the

                   activity. Nitrate assimilation rates and distribution
                   of the archaeal amoA gene were also investigated in
                   the Philippine Sea and in the Kuroshio Current. At
                   all the stations, while the surface nitrate was
                   depleted ({$<$}0.1 ?M), active nitrate assimilation
                   was observed with mean rates of 1400, 270, and 96
                   ?molN m?2 d?1 in the ECS, the Philippine Sea, and the
                   Kuroshio Current, respectively. Archaeal amoA was
                   observed at shallower light depths, namely at or
                   above 10\% light depth, in the ECS than in other
                   regions, suggesting that nitrification occurred
                   within the euphotic zone in the ECS, especially on
                   the shelf. Moreover, a station on the continental
                   shelf of the ECS exhibited a considerable discrepancy
                   between the nitrate assimilation rate (1500 ?molN m?2
                   d?1) and vertical nitrate flux (98 ?molN m?2 d?1).
                   Here, 6.7 {$\pm$} 3.1 ? 103 and 2.5 {$\pm$} 0.7 ? 105
                   copies mL?1 of archaeal amoA were detected at 10\%
                   and 1\% light depths relative to the surface,
                   respectively. Thus nitrification within the euphotic
                   zone would be attributed at least in part to the
                   observed discrepancy between nitrate assimilation and
                   vertical flux. These observations imply that the
                   assumption of a direct relationship between new
                   production, export production, and measured nitrate
                   assimilation is misplaced, particularly regarding the
                   continental shelf of the ECS.},

                   water depth near Huntington Beach, California,
                   between June and October of 2006. Each bloom was
                   preceded by a vertical NO3 flux event
                   6\textendash{}10 d earlier. NO3 concentrations were
                   estimated using a temperature proxy that was verified
                   by comparison with the limited NO3 observations. The
                   lower\textendash{}water-column vertical NO3 flux from
                   vertical advection was inferred from observed
                   vertical isotherm displacement. Turbulent vertical
                   eddy diffusivity was parameterized based on the
                   observed background ({$<$} 0.3 cycles h-1)
                   stratification and vertical shear in the horizontal
                   currents. The first vertical nitrate flux event in
                   June contained both advective and turbulent fluxes,
                   whereas the later two events were primarily
                   turbulent, driven by shear in the lower part of the
                   water column. The correlation between the NO3 flux
                   and the observed chlorophyll a (Chl a) was maximum
                   (r2 = 0.40) with an 8-d lag. A simple
                   nitrate\textendash{}phytoplankton model using a
                   linear uptake function and driven with the NO3 flux
                   captured the timing, magnitude, and duration of the
                   three Chl a blooms (skill = 0.61) using optimal net
                   growth rate parameters that were within the expected
                   range. Vertical and horizontal advection of Chl a
                   past the measurement site were too small to explain
                   the observed Chl a increases during the blooms. The
                   vertical NO3 flux was a primary control on the growth
                   events, and estimation of both the advective
                   (upwelled) and turbulent fluxes is necessary to best
                   predict these episodic blooms.},

  abstract =      {Microbial activity is a fundamental component of
                   oceanic nutrient cycles. Photosynthetic microbes,
                   collectively termed phytoplankton, are responsible
                   for the vast majority of primary production in marine
                   waters. The availability of nutrients in the upper
                   ocean frequently limits the activity and abundance of
                   these organisms. Experimental data have revealed two
                   broad regimes of phytoplankton nutrient limitation in
                   the modern upper ocean. Nitrogen availability tends
                   to limit productivity throughout much of the surface
                   low-latitude ocean, where the supply of nutrients
                   from the subsurface is relatively slow. In contrast,
                   iron often limits productivity where subsurface
                   nutrient supply is enhanced, including within the
                   main oceanic upwelling regions of the Southern Ocean
                   and the eastern equatorial Pacific. Phosphorus,
                   vitamins and micronutrients other than iron may also
                   (co-)limit marine phytoplankton. The spatial patterns
                   and importance of co-limitation, however, remain
                   unclear. Variability in the stoichiometries of
                   nutrient supply and biological demand are key
                   determinants of oceanic nutrient limitation.
                   Deciphering the mechanisms that underpin this
                   variability, and the consequences for marine
                   microbes, will be a challenge. But such knowledge
                   will be crucial for accurately predicting the
                   consequences of ongoing anthropogenic perturbations
                   to oceanic nutrient biogeochemistry.},

  abstract =      {Uptake rate of nitrate and ammonium was studied as a
                   function of nitrate or ammonium concentration with
                   cultures of 16 species of marine phytoplankton.
                   Half-saturation constants (the concentration
                   supporting an uptake rate one-half the maximum rate)
                   were computed as a measure of the ability of a
                   species to use low levels of nitrate and ammonium.
                   The half-saturation constant (Ks) varied
                   approximately in proportion to cell size and
                   inversely with specific growth rate. Small-celled
                   oceanic species, such as Coccolithus huxleyi, showed
                   the lowest K8 values ({$\leqslant$}0.5{$\mu$}m) and
                   Gonyaulax polyedra the highest (Ks {$>$} 5
                   {$\mathrm{\mu}$}m). The Ks values are considered to
                   be important characteristics of organisms living in
                   nitrogen-limited environments. Some apparent success
                   was achieved in predicting the competitive advantage
                   of one species over another by calculating specific
                   growth rates as functions of nitrate and ammonium
                   concentration for species with known growth response
                   to irradiance, temperature, and daylength. For
                   example, at about 20C and 16 hr daylength C. huxleyi
                   should be able to compete successfully with
                   Skeletonema costatum when nitrate, ammonium, and
                   irradiance are low. Skeletonema costatum should grow
                   faster than C. huxleyi only when irradiance and
                   nitrate or ammonium are fairly high. Rock pool forms
                   appear to be relatively unsuccessful in the ocean
                   because of a sluggish response to irradiance and not
                   because of an inability to use low levels of nitrate
                   and ammonium. The success of G. polyedra, often the
                   dominant dinoflagellate in local red water blooms,
                   appears to be due to its vertical migration from the
                   sea surface in daylight to nitrate-rich water at
                   10-15-m depth at night, rather than to any special
                   ability to grow rapidly or use low levels of nitrate
                   and ammonium.},

                   plankton ecologists fall out into two groups: Those
                   who delight in finding the patterns in nature that
                   can be explained by size, and those who delight in
                   finding exceptions to the established size-dependent
                   rules. I came to appreciate the degree to which the
                   satisfaction of both groups is equally justified. The
                   mechanisms underlying the size-dependent patterns
                   have undoubtedly steered the general course of
                   phytoplankton evolution, but the organisms that do
                   not abide by the rules reveal the wonderful diversity
                   of ways in which cells have managed to disobey the
                   ``laws'' scripted for them. The simplicity of the
                   general relationships serves as a stable backdrop
                   against which the exceptions can shine. By
                   understanding the forces that have driven the design
                   of these exceptions, we can begin to understand the

                   picophytoplankton is greatest in warm and

                   comprehensive review of the data available in the
                   literature from oceanic and coastal estuarine areas.
                   Results show that picophytoplankton dominate
                   ({$\geq$}50\%) the biomass and production in
                   oligotrophic (chlorophyll a [Chl a] {$<$} 0.3 mg
                   m-3), nutrient poor (NO3 + NO2 {$<$} 1
                   {$\mathrm{\mu}$}M), and warm ({$>$}26\textdegree{}C)
                   waters, but represent {$<$}10\% of autotrophic
                   biomass and production in rich (Chl a {$>$} 5 mg m-3)
                   and cold {$<$}3\textdegree{}C) waters. There is,
                   however, a strong covariation between temperature and
                   nutrient concentration (r = -0.95, P {$<$} 0.001),
                   but the number of observations where both temperature
                   and nutrient concentrations are available is too
                   small to allow attempts to statistically separate
                   their effects. The results of mesocosm nutrient
                   addition experiments during summer in the
                   Mediterranean Sea allowed the dissociation of the
                   effects of temperature from those of nutrients on
                   pico phytoplankton production and biomass and
                   validated the magnitude at which picoplankton
                   dominates ({$\geq$}50\%) autotrophic biomass and
                   production obtained in the comparative analysis. The
                   fraction contributed by picoplankton significantly
                   declined (r2 = 0.76 and 0.90, respectively, P {$<$}
                   0.001) as total autotrophic production and biomass
                   increased. These results support the increasing
                   importance of picophytoplankton in warm, oligotrophic
                   waters. The reduced contribution of picophytoplankton
                   in warm productive waters is hypothesized here to be
                   due to increased loss rates, whereas the dominance of
                   picophytoplankton in warm, oligotrophic waters is
                   attributable to the differential capacity to use
                   nutrients as a function of differences in size and
                   capacity of intrinsic growth of picophytoplankton and
                   larger phytoplankton cells.},

                   the far side of the North Pole from the Atlantic, but
                   it is becoming more like its larger neighbor as the
                   climate warms. Polyakov et al. show that this region
                   is also evolving toward a state of weakened
                   stratification with increased vertical mixing,
                   release of oceanic heat, and less sea ice. These
                   changes could have considerable impacts on other
                   geophysical and biogeochemical aspects of the Arctic

                   sea-ice loss is a leading indicator of climate change
                   and can be attributed, in large part, to atmospheric
                   forcing. Here, we show that recent ice reductions,
                   weakening of the halocline, and shoaling of the
                   intermediate-depth Atlantic Water layer in the
                   eastern Eurasian Basin have increased winter
                   ventilation in the ocean interior, making this region
                   structurally similar to that of the western Eurasian
                   Basin. The associated enhanced release of oceanic
                   heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate
                   now comparable to losses from atmospheric
                   thermodynamic forcing, thus explaining the recent
                   reduction in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian
                   Basin. This encroaching ``atlantification'' of the
                   Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a
                   new Arctic climate state, with a substantially
                   greater role for Atlantic inflows.},

                   of Svalbard is dominated by the advection of warm,
                   salty and nutrient-rich Atlantic Water (AW). This
                   oceanic heat contributes to keeping the area
                   relatively free of ice. The last years have seen a
                   dramatic decrease in regional sea ice extent, which
                   is expected to drive large increases in pelagic
                   primary production and thereby changes in marine
                   ecology and nutrient cycling. In a concerted effort,
                   we conducted five cruises to the area in winter,
                   spring, summer and fall of 2014, in order to
                   understand the physical and biogeochemical controls
                   of carbon cycling, for the first time from a
                   year-round point of view. We document (1) the
                   offshore location of the wintertime front between
                   salty AW and fresher Surface Water in the ocean
                   surface, (2) thermal convection of Atlantic Water
                   over the shelf slope, likely enhancing vertical
                   {\~n}nutrient fluxes, and (3) the importance of ice
                   melt derived upper ocean stratification for the
                   spring bloom timing. Our findings strongly confirm
                   the hypothesis that this ``Atlantification'', as it
                   has been called, of the shelf slope area north of
                   Svalbard resulting from the advection of AW
                   alleviates both nutrient and light limitations at the
                   same time, leading to increased pelagic primary

  abstract =      {The Arctic Ocean is currently on a fast track toward
                   seasonally ice-free conditions. Although most
                   attention has been on the accelerating summer sea ice
                   decline, large changes are also occurring in winter.
                   This study assesses past, present, and possible
                   future change in regional Northern Hemisphere sea ice
                   extent throughout the year by examining sea ice
                   concentration based on observations back to 1950,
                   including the satellite record since 1979. At
                   present, summer sea ice variability and change
                   dominate in the perennial ice-covered Beaufort,
                   Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, and Kara Seas, with
                   the East Siberian Sea explaining the largest fraction
                   of September ice loss (22\%). Winter variability and
                   change occur in the seasonally ice-covered seas
                   farther south: the Barents Sea, Sea of Okhotsk,
                   Greenland Sea, and Baffin Bay, with the Barents Sea
                   carrying the largest fraction of loss in March
                   (27\%). The distinct regions of summer and winter sea
                   ice variability and loss have generally been
                   consistent since 1950, but appear at present to be in
                   transformation as a result of the rapid ice loss in
                   all seasons. As regions become seasonally ice free,
                   future ice loss will be dominated by winter. The Kara
                   Sea appears as the first currently perennial
                   ice-covered sea to become ice free in September.
                   Remaining on currently observed trends, the Arctic
                   shelf seas are estimated to become seasonally ice
                   free in the 2020s, and the seasonally ice-covered
                   seas farther south to become ice free year-round from
                   the 2050s.},

                   approaches the previous record high (2007) due to

                   temperatures, despite surface temperature (SST)
                   cooling. In the last decade, warmer LL waters arrive
                   earlier (1.6 {$\pm$} 1.1 days/yr), though winds and

                   freshwater flux variability (strongly driven by
                   transport) exceeds variability in other Arctic
                   freshwater sources. Remote data (winds, SST) prove
                   insufficient for quantifying variability, indicating
                   interannual change can still only be assessed by in

                   its patchy, episodic nature and a scarcity of direct
                   measurements, especially in the Arctic Ocean. In this
                   study, we exploit a historical record of nearly 3,000
                   conductivity-temperature-depth profiles collected in
                   the shelf and shelf-slope waters of the Canadian
                   Arctic Ocean from 2002 to 2016 to characterize the
                   variability of 28,872 internal wave-driven turbulent
                   dissipation and mixing rate estimates from a
                   finescale parameterization. We find that these
                   estimates of wave-driven dissipation rates and
                   associated diapycnal diffusivities are generally low,
                   but exhibit wide variability, each spanning several
                   orders of magnitude. We further find that
                   stratification plays a significant role in modulating
                   the mixing rate both vertically and regionally within
                   the study domain. Dissipation rate and diffusivity
                   estimates display a weak seasonal cycle, but no
                   evidence of statistically significant interannual
                   trends over this period. Exceptionally large
                   localized temporal variability appears to dominate
                   other potential underlying patterns. The presence of
                   strong upper ocean stratification combined with
                   predominately weak dissipation rate estimates implies
                   that many regions in the Canadian Arctic Ocean are
                   likely in a molecular or buoyancy-controlled mixing
                   regime. Even when the concept of a turbulent-enhanced
                   diffusivity is potentially relevant, most turbulent
                   heat flux estimates out of the Atlantic Water
                   thermocline are smaller than the average value
                   required to close the standardly assumed Arctic Ocean
                   heat budget. In contrast, we find evidence for
                   isolated occurrences of anomalously large heat
                   fluxes, which may disproportionately contribute to
                   the liberation of Atlantic Water heat toward the
                   surface sea ice pack.},

  abstract =      {The Arctic sea ice cover is thinning and retreating,
                   causing changes in surface roughness that in turn
                   modify the momentum flux from the atmosphere through
                   the ice into the ocean. New model simulations
                   comprising variable sea ice drag coefficients for
                   both the air and water interface demonstrate that the
                   heterogeneity in sea ice surface roughness
                   significantly impacts the spatial distribution and
                   trends of ocean surface stress during the last
                   decades. Simulations with constant sea ice drag
                   coefficients as used in most climate models show an
                   increase in annual mean ocean surface stress (0.003
                   N/m2 per decade, 4.6\%) due to the reduction of ice
                   thickness leading to a weakening of the ice and
                   accelerated ice drift. In contrast, with variable
                   drag coefficients our simulations show annual mean
                   ocean surface stress is declining at a rate of -0.002
                   N/m2 per decade (3.1\%) over the period
                   1980\textendash{}2013 because of a significant
                   reduction in surface roughness associated with an
                   increasingly thinner and younger sea ice cover. The
                   effectiveness of sea ice in transferring momentum
                   does not only depend on its resistive strength
                   against the wind forcing but is also set by its top
                   and bottom surface roughness varying with ice types
                   and ice conditions. This reveals the need to account
                   for sea ice surface roughness variations in climate
                   simulations in order to correctly represent the
                   implications of sea ice loss under global warming.},

                   organic carbon (POC) exported from the surface waters
                   of the world ocean and remineralized at depth is
                   critical to constraining models of the global carbon
                   cycle, yet remains controversial. The use of upper
                   ocean sediment traps is still one of the primary
                   tools for determining this export flux, although trap
                   fluxes have been shown to vary significantly because
                   of hydrodynamic and sample collection biases. Over
                   the past decade, 234Th increasingly has been used as
                   a tracer to estimate POC export from the euphotic
                   zone by multiplying the depth-integrated 234Th flux
                   by the POC/234Th ratio of sinking particles. The
                   accuracy of this technique is highly dependent on the
                   natural variability in the POC/234Th ratio and 234Th
                   flux, yet the significance of this variability to
                   estimates of POC export remains uncertain. Based on
                   an analysis of new 234Th and POC data from the
                   Labrador Sea and a review of 25 previous independent
                   field studies, we report that POC export fluxes can
                   vary 2\textendash{}10 times or more solely because of
                   variability in the POC/234Th ratio and procedures
                   used to estimate the 234Th flux. Recommended
                   improvements include studies of the biological,
                   chemical, and physical mechanisms controlling
                   234Th-organic matter interactions in seawater;

                   microstructure in the southeastern Beaufort Sea, a
                   strongly stratified, low-energy environment. The
                   measurements were collected over 10 days in 2015 by
                   an ocean glider equipped with microstructure
                   instrumentation; they yield 28,575 shear-derived and
                   21,577 temperature-derived {$\epsilon$} estimates. We
                   find agreement within a factor of 2 from the two
                   types of estimates when {$\epsilon$} exceeds 3
                   \texttimes{} 10-11 W/kg, a threshold we identify as
                   the noise floor of the shear-derived estimates.
                   However, the temperature-derived estimates suggest
                   that the dissipation rate is lower than this
                   threshold in 58\% of our observations. Further, the
                   noise floor of the shear measurements artificially
                   skews the statistical distribution of {$\epsilon$}
                   below 10-10 W/kg, that is, in 70\% of our
                   observations. The shear measurements overestimate
                   portions of the geometric mean vertical profile of
                   {$\epsilon$} by more than an order of magnitude and
                   underestimate the overall variability of {$\epsilon$}
                   by at least 2 orders of magnitude. We further discuss
                   uncertainties that arise in both temperature- and
                   shear-derived {$\epsilon$} estimates in strongly
                   stratified, weakly turbulent conditions, and we
                   demonstrate how turbulence spectra are systematically
                   modified by stratification under these conditions.
                   Using evidence from the temperature-gradient spectral
                   shapes and from the observed {$\epsilon$}
                   distributions, we suggest that the
                   temperature-derived dissipation rates are reliable to
                   values as small as 2 \texttimes{} 10-12 W/kg, making
                   them preferable for characterizing the turbulent
                   dissipation rates in the weakly turbulent environment
                   of this study.},

                   consists of over 5000 \emph{P}-\emph{E} experiments,
                   provides information on the spatio-temporal

  slope, \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsuperscript{\emph{B}}, where the superscripts
  \emph{B} indicate normalisation to concentration of chlorophyll) that are
  fundamental inputs for models (satellite-based and otherwise) of marine
  primary production that use chlorophyll as the state variable.
  Quality-control measures consisted of removing samples with abnormally high
  parameter values and flags were added to denote whether the spectral quality

  abstract =      {One of the logical predictions for a future Arctic
                   characterized by warmer waters and reduced sea-ice is
                   that new taxa will expand or invade Arctic seafloor
                   habitats. Specific predictions regarding where this
                   will occur and which taxa are most likely to become
                   established or excluded are lacking, however. We
                   synthesize recent studies and conduct new analyses in
                   the context of climate forecasts and a
                   paleontological perspective to make concrete
                   predictions as to relevant mechanisms, regions, and
                   functional traits contributing to future biodiversity
                   changes. Historically, a warmer Arctic is more
                   readily invaded or transited by boreal taxa than it
                   is during cold periods. Oceanography of an ice-free
                   Arctic Ocean, combined with life-history traits of
                   invading taxa and availability of suitable habitat,
                   determine expansion success. It is difficult to
                   generalize as to which taxonomic groups or locations
                   are likely to experience expansion, however, since
                   species-specific, and perhaps population-specific
                   autecologies, will determine success or failure.
                   Several examples of expansion into the Arctic have
                   been noted, and along with the results from the
                   relatively few Arctic biological time-series suggest
                   inflow shelves (Barents and Chukchi Seas), as well as
                   West Greenland and the western Kara Sea, are most
                   likely locations for expansion. Apparent temperature
                   thresholds were identified for characteristic Arctic
                   and boreal benthic fauna suggesting strong potential
                   for range constrictions of Arctic, and expansions of
                   boreal, fauna in the near future. Increasing human
                   activities in the region could speed introductions of
                   boreal fauna and reduce the value of a planktonic
                   dispersal stage. Finally, shelf regions are likely to
                   experience a greater impact, and also one with
                   greater potential consequences, than the deep Arctic
                   basin. Future research strategies should focus on
                   monitoring as well as compiling basic physiological
                   and life-history information of Arctic and boreal
                   taxa, and integrate that with projections of human
                   activities and likely ecosystem consequences to
                   facilitate development of management strategies now
                   and in the future.},

                   transport processes that may produce such a
                   phenomenon. For the eddy investigated, the dominant
                   mechanism is found to be ageostrophic circulation
                   resulting from a perturbation of the circular flow of
                   the eddy. This can produce upwelling velocities of
                   order 10md-1. Ekman pumping due to wind stress on the
                   eddy also produces upwelling within, but on a smaller
                   scale of {$\sim$}0.5md-1. There is no evidence that
                   self-propagation of the eddy leads to an enhanced
                   nutrient flux by displacement upwards of
                   nutrient-laden deeper isopycnals over the core of the
                   eddy. Deeper winter mixing within the eddy relative
                   to the surroundings, however, may contribute to the
                   elevated nutrient levels.},

                   estimates of circumpolar riverine nutrient fluxes
                   from the PARTNERS (Pan-Arctic River Transport of
                   Nutrients, Organic Matter, and Suspended Sediments)
                   Project with a regionally configured version of the

                   the distribution and availability of dissolved
                   riverine N in the Arctic Ocean, assess its importance

                   to potential bacterial production fueled by riverine
                   C. Because riverine dissolved organic nitrogen is
                   remineralized slowly, riverine N is available for
                   uptake well into the open ocean. Despite this, we

  abstract =      {The first quasi-annual time series of nutrients and
                   chlorophyll fluorescence in the southeast Beaufort
                   Sea showed that mixing, whether driven by wind, local
                   convection, or brine rejection, and the ensuing
                   replenishment of nutrients at the surface were
                   minimal during autumn and winter. Anomalously high
                   inventories of nutrients were observed briefly in
                   late December, coinciding with the passage of an eddy
                   generated offshore. The concentrations of NO3- in the
                   upper mixed layer were otherwise low and increased
                   slowly from January to April. The coincident decline
                   of NO2-suggested nitrification near the surface. The
                   vernal drawdown of NO3- in 2004 began at the
                   ice-water interface during May, leaving as little as
                   0.9 mu M of NO3- when the ice broke up. A subsurface
                   chlorophyll maximum (SCM) developed promptly and
                   deepened with the nitracline until early August. The
                   diatomdominated SCM possibly mediated half of the
                   seasonal NO3- consumption while generating the
                   primary NO2- maximum. Dissolved inorganic carbon and
                   soluble reactive phosphorus above the SCM continued
                   to decline after NO3- was depleted, indicating that
                   net community production (NCP) exceeded NO3--based
                   new production. These dynamics contrast with those of
                   productive Arctic waters where nutrient replenishment
                   in the upper euphotic zone is extensive and NCP is
                   fueled primarily by allochthonous NO3-. The projected
                   increase in the supply of heat and freshwater to the
                   Arctic should bolster vertical stability, further
                   reduce NO3--based new production, and increase the
                   relative contribution of the SCM. This trend might be
                   reversed locally or regionally by the physical
                   forcing events that episodically deliver nutrients to
                   the upper euphotic zone.},

                   biologically available nitrogen on earth, and its
                   presence or absence impacts net primary production
                   and global biogeochemical cycles. Here, we report
                   rates of 3.5\textendash{}17.2 nmol N L-1 d-1 in the
                   ice-free coastal Alaskan Arctic to show that N2
                   fixation in the Arctic Ocean may be an important
                   source of nitrogen to a seasonally nitrogen-limited
                   system. If widespread in surface waters over ice-free
                   shelves throughout the Arctic, N2 fixation could
                   contribute up to 3.5 Tg N yr-1 to the Arctic nitrogen
                   budget. At these rates, N2 fixation occurring in
                   ice-free summer waters would offset up to 27.1\% of
                   the Arctic denitrification deficit and contribute an
                   additional 2.7\% to N2 fixation globally, making it
                   an important consideration in the current debate of
                   whether nitrogen in the global ocean is in steady
                   state. Additional investigations of high-latitude
                   marine diazotrophic physiology are required to refine
                   these N2 fixation estimates.},

                   Previous reports based on bottle data have identified
                   a distinct lower halocline layer associated with an
                   NO minimum at about S=34 2 that was proposed to be
                   formed initially in the Nansen Basin and then
                   advected downstream Greater resolution afforded by
                   our data reveal an even more pronounced NO minimum
                   within the upper cold halocline of the Makarov Basin
                   Thus a distinct lower salinity source ventilated the

                   larger Eurasian River water influence overlies this
                   halocline source in the Makarov Observations in the

                   confirming multiple lower halocline influences

                   ranges for a classification of major water masses.
                   The central Laptev Sea is dominated by predominantly
                   marine waters, locally formed polynya waters and
                   riverine summer surface waters. Marine waters enter
                   the central Laptev Sea from the northwestern Laptev
                   Sea shelf and originate from the Kara Sea or the
                   Arctic Ocean halocline. Local polynya waters are
                   formed in the Laptev Sea coastal polynyas. Riverine
                   summer surface waters are formed from Lena river
                   discharge and local melt. We use a principal
                   component analysis (PCA) in order to assess the
                   distribution and importance of water masses within
                   the Laptev Sea. This mathematical method is applied
                   to hydro-chemical summer data sets from the Laptev
                   Sea from five years and allows to define water types
                   based on objective and statistically significant
                   criteria. We argue that the PCA-derived water types
                   are consistent with the Laptev Sea hydrography and
                   indeed represent the major water masses on the
                   central Laptev Sea shelf. Budgets estimated for the
                   thus defined major Laptev Sea water masses indicate
                   that freshwater inflow from the western Laptev Sea is
                   about half or in the same order of magnitude as
                   freshwater stored in locally formed polynya waters.
                   Imported water dominates the nutrient budget in the
                   central Laptev Sea; and only in years with enhanced
                   local polynya activity is the nutrient budget of the
                   locally formed water in the same order as imported
                   nutrients.},

                   calibration procedures have greatly increased the
                   accuracy of nitrate measurements using an in situ
                   ultraviolet spectrophotometer (ISUS). Two major
                   changes in the algorithm involve application of a
                   temperature-dependent correction to the bromide
                   spectrum and then using the observed temperature and
                   salinity to subtract the bromide component before
                   fitting nitrate. By reducing the degrees of freedom
                   in calculating nitrate concentrations, the accuracy
                   of the ISUS instrument is substantially improved. The
                   new algorithm was tested in environments ranging from
                   the Southern Ocean to oligotrophic eastern Pacific
                   seawater and found to be applicable at all
                   temperatures and depths. The standard error of the
                   estimate for regression between ISUS nitrate values
                   and discrete samples measured by standard wet
                   chemistry methods for the combined data set is
                   reduced by greater than 2-fold (1.4 down to 0.65 mu
                   M) using the new algorithm. This corresponds to a
                   5-fold reduction in variance (2.0 down to 0.4 mu
                   M(2)). Although biofouling and calibration drift
                   remain issues for any instrument deployed in situ for
                   long periods of time, using the measured salinity and
                   temperature to correct the ultraviolet spectra before
                   the nitrate calculations will reduce the impacts of

                   observational network is proposed as an element of
                   the Arctic Observing Network (AON). Three
                   August-September cruises, one every two years, will
                   be conducted, with extensive measurements along
                   continental margins, a boundary current conduit;
                   cruises will cover vast areas from Svalbard to the
                   East Siberian Sea. The program ties together
                   oceanographic, chemical, and ice observations using
                   moorings, repeated oceanographic sections, and
                   Lagrangian drifters to provide vital information
                   about Arctic Ocean changes. The overarching goal of
                   the study as an AON element is to compile a cohesive
                   picture of the state and transformations of Atlantic
                   Water (AW) in the EMB, with particular focus on three
                   major observational targets: (1) along-slope AW
                   transport by the boundary currents (2) interaction of
                   AW branches with shelf waters, deep basin interior
                   and upper ocean (3) EMB indications of changes in the
                   upper ocean circulation. The proposed targets are
                   broad in scope and pose a wide range of challenges to
                   modern high-latitude observational oceanography. The
                   EMB's size and location mean that this part of the
                   Arctic Ocean is representative of pan-arctic
                   conditions and processes, and therefore appropriate
                   for long-term observing. Therefore, the project is an
                   important element of the pan-AON. This dataset

                   equatorial region, there was little vertical
                   diffusion of nitrate ({$<$} 10-3 mmol m-2 d-1). An
                   estimate was made of the two-dimensional advective
                   balance of nitrate between upwelling and the

                   variation in the uptake rate of nitrate and ammonium
                   in the Central Atlantic was studied. The calculated
                   diffusive nitrate flux showed a sharp latitudinal
                   gradient, with the lowest nitrate supply (0.00037
                   {$\mu$}mol m-3 d-1) in the South Atlantic subtropical
                   gyre and the highest values (23.5 {$\mu$}mol m-3 d-1)
                   between the Equator and 15\textdegree{}N. The uptake
                   rate of nitrate was inhibited at high irradiance at
                   most stations. Both nitrate and ammonium uptake rates
                   were lowest (about 3 and 10 umol m-3 d-1,
                   respectively) at the southern end of the transect and
                   increased (about 20 and 55 {$\mu$}mol m-3 d-1,
                   respectively) towards the Equator, with this increase
                   being much greater for ammonium than for nitrate
                   uptake. The f-ratio was highest ({$\approx$}0.4) just
                   south of the Equator and lowest ({$\approx$}0.03) at
                   the southern end of the transect. The slope between

                   gross primary production, calculated from O2 -based
                   measurements, in surface waters (4.72 {$\pm$} 1.54)
                   was somewhat lower, but not significantly so, than
                   the expected C/N ratio of 6.6. The average uptake
                   rate of nitrate did not differ significantly from the
                   average estimated diffusive supply of nitrate to the
                   biogenic layer over the Central Atlantic. However,
                   the nitrate uptake rate increased as the
                   {$\textfrac{1}{3}$} power of the diffusive nitrate
                   flux to the biogenic layer. As a result, nitrate
                   uptake far exceeded (by up to 100-fold) the nitrate
                   flux to the biogenic layer in the stations where the
                   supply of nitrate was lowest. The excess nitrate
                   uptake averaged 0.65 {$\pm$} 0.24 mmol NO3 m-2 d-1
                   (range, 0.05\textendash{}1.9 mmol NO3 m-2 d-1), which
                   must be supplied through atmospheric deposition and
                   other perturbation events. This excess nitrate uptake
                   is relatively large compared to the diffusive supply
                   in the most unproductive areas, where external
                   nitrate inputs fuel the new production. In contrast,
                   these sources of nitrate are far less significant
                   where high diffusive fluxes suffice to maintain high
                   nitrate uptake rates.},

  volume =        {52},
  year =          {2007},
  abstract =      {Measurements of the intra-tidal and spring-neap
                   variation in the vertical flux of nitrate into the
                   base of the sub-surface chlorophyll maximum (SCM)
                   were made at the shelf edge of the Celtic Sea, a
                   region with strong internal mixing driven by an
                   internal tide. The neap tide daily mean nitrate flux
                   was 1.3 (0.9-1.8, 95\% confidence interval) mmol m-2
                   d-1. The spring tide flux was initially estimated as
                   3.5 (2.3-5.2, 95\% confidence interval) mmol m-2 d-1.
                   The higher spring tide nitrate flux was the result of
                   turbulent dissipation occurring within the base of
                   the SCM as compared to deeper dissipation during neap
                   tides and was dominated by short events associated
                   with the passage of internal solitons. Taking into
                   account the likely under-sampling of these short
                   mixing events raised the spring tide nitrate flux
                   estimate to about 9 mmol m-2 d-1. The neap tide
                   nitrate flux was sufficient to support substantial
                   new production and a considerable fraction of the
                   observed rates of carbon fixation. Spring tide fluxes
                   were potentially in excess of the capacity of the
                   phytoplankton community to uptake nitrate. This
                   potential excess nitrate flux during spring tides may
                   be utilized to support new production during the
                   lower mixing associated with the transition toward
                   neap tide. The shelf edge is shown to be a region
                   with a significantly different phytoplankton
                   community as compared to the adjacent Celtic Sea and
                   northeast Atlantic Ocean, highlighting the role of
                   gradients in physical processes leading to gradients
                   in ecosystem structure.},

  abstract =      {We estimate the diapcynal nitrate flux in the
                   seasonally stratified western Irish Sea using the
                   dissipation method. By comparing the divergence of
                   the reported benthic and diapcynal nitrate fluxes, we
                   are able to explain much of the observed annual
                   summer decline in deep-water nitrate at this
                   location. We then show that the new production,
                   fuelled by the diapcynal nitrate flux, is of a
                   similar magnitude to that associated with the spring
                   bloom. This suggests that the physical processes
                   responsible for the diapcynal nitrate flux will set
                   the limit on new production at this location.
                   High-resolution mid-water column ADCP measurements
                   show an average thermocline gradient Richardson
                   number of 1, thus suggesting episodes of enhanced
                   shear could result in shear instability, and
                   therefore mixing within the thermocline. Bulk shear
                   measurements reveal episodes of enhanced shear in the
                   form of spikes, during which time the bulk shear
                   vector takes the form of a clockwise rotating vector
                   which has a period close to the local inertial
                   period. The episodes of shear spikes are correlated
                   to the wind and are consistent with observations made
                   elsewhere. Estimates of profiles of the rate of
                   dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy, based on
                   microstructure velocity measurements, show that
                   during a shear spike the dissipation rate within the
                   thermocline, and therefore the buoyancy (and nitrate)
                   flux, is enhanced by a factor of 4 when compared to
                   periods with no shear spikes. Intermittent shear
                   spikes are, therefore, an important mechanism for
                   enhancing mixing across the shelf sea seasonal
                   thermocline, and therefore delivery of nitrate to the
                   euphotic zone, at this location.},
