This repository contains code, figures, data, and other supplemental material for XXX.

The main effort is concentrated in the following notebooks:
1. A database of hydrography and seawater nitrate concentrations:
  1. [Collecting and merging](1-A-compile-nitrate.ipynb)
  2. [Analysis](1-B-analyze-nitrate.ipynb)
2. A compilation of nitrate fluxes
  1. [Compiling nitrate fluxes](2-A-compile-fluxes.ipynb)
  2. [Analyzing that compilation](2-B-analyze-fluxes.ipynb)
3. [Comparison of nitrate stocks and fluxes with primary production](3-primary-production.ipynb)
